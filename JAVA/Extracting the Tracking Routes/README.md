# Extracting the Tracing route for the given domain

- Traceroute is a network diagnostic tool used to track in real-time the pathway taken by a packet on an IP network 
from source to destination, reporting the IP addresses of all the routers it pinged in between. 
Traceroute also records the time taken for each hop the packet makes during its route to the destination.

<br>
Let's try out ourself😉, and give it a try ourselves to Tracert Commad.
<br>
But 1st let's have a quick start:

## Quick Start
### Clone this repository
``` 
git clone https://github.com/abhijeet007rocks8/Dev-Scripts.git
```

### Change Directory
```
cd Java
```
```
cd Extracting the Tracking Routes

```

### Run the application

1. Give Input for IP address or web address for the destination site .
2. Press Enter.
3. Basically, you can now see, each route it takes for a packet of information to travel between a local computer and a destination IP address or domain.
4. Also you can see the time recorded for the packet of information makes during its route to the destination.
5. While running this application you will see list of hops, that data packets take along their path to the designated IP address or domain.
6. Search those path's IP address https://www.iplocation.net/ip-lookup , through this you will be get to know the location for those hops.

### Hope you get to know a lot also had fun while experementing with the tracert command.

- Between, you can also run the command `traceroute yourdomain.com` in your cmd 🙂✌.

# Happy Hacking✨🎉
