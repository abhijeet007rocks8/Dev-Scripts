Swing package
Java Swing is a part of Java Foundation Classes (JFC) that is used to create window-based applications. It is built on the top of AWT (Abstract Windowing Toolkit) package and entirely written in java. javax.swing components are platform-independent or lightweight components i.e. its components doesn't depends on the resources of the OS (Operating System).

javax.swing package provides classes such as JFrame, JTextField, JTextArea, JRadioButton, JMenu, JColorChooser etc.

AWT package
AWT stands for Abstract Window Toolkit. In Java, AWT is a package used to develop GUI or window-based applications in java. But java.awt components are platform-dependent i.e. components are displayed according to the view of operating system. AWT components are heavyweight i.e. its components depends on the resources of OS (Operating System).

java.awt package provides classes such as Graphics (which has helped a lot in this project), CheckBox, Choice, List etc.
