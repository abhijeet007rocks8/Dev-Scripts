# Credit card approval prediction

## Description
Commercial banks receive a lot of applications for credit cards. Many of them get rejected for many reasons, like high loan balances, low income levels, or too many 
inquiries on an individual's credit report. This task can be automated with the power of machine learning. In this project, we will build an automatic credit card approval 
predictor using machine learning.

## Tech Stack
Python

## Package used
 - pandas
 - numpy
 - matplotlib
 - scikit-learn

## Install the dependencies
 - Install python 3.8.3 and above
 - Further install this all libraries using terminal
   - pip install pandas
