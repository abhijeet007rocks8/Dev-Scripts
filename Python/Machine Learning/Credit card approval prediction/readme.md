# Credit card approval prediction

## Description
Commercial banks receive a lot of applications for credit cards. Many of them get rejected for many reasons, like high loan balances, low income levels, or too many 
inquiries on an individual's credit report. This task can be automated with the power of machine learning. In this project, we will build an automatic credit card approval 
predictor using machine learning.

## Tech Stack
Python

## Package used
 - pandas
 - numpy
 - matplotlib
 - scikit-learn

## Project Task 
 - Credit card data
 - Inspecting the data

 - Preprocessing the data (part i)
 - Splitting the dataset into train and test sets
 - Preprocessing the data (part ii)
 - Fitting a logistic regression model to the train set
 - Making predictions and evaluating performance
