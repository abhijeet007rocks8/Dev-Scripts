# Credit card approval prediction

## Description
Commercial banks receive a lot of applications for credit cards. Many of them get rejected for many reasons, like high loan balances, low income levels, or too many 
inquiries on an individual's credit report. This task can be automated with the power of machine learning. In this project, we will build an automatic credit card approval 
predictor using machine learning.

## Tech Stack
Python

## Package used
 - pandas
 - numpy
 - matplotlib
 - scikit-learn

## Install the dependencies
 - Install python 3.8.3 and above
 - Further install this all libraries using terminal
   ```bash
   pip install pandas
   ```
   ```bash 
   pip install numpy 
   ```
   ```bash
   pip install matplotlib
   ```
   ```bash
   pip install scikit-learn
   ```
- Clone this repository : 
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/abhijeet007rocks8/Dev-Scripts.git
  ```
- Change directory :
  ```bash
  cd Python
  ```
  ```bash
  cd Machine Learning
  ```
  ```bash
  cd Credit card approval prediction
  ```

 - Since the data is confidential, the contributor of this dataset has anonymized the feature names. The features of this dataset have been anonymized to protect the privacy
 - Dataset contains both numeric and non-numeric data. The features 2, 7, 10 and 14 contain numeric values and all the other features contain non-numeric values.
 - The dataset also contains values from several ranges. Some features have a value range of 0–28, some have a range of 2–67, and some have a range of 1017–100000
 
## Project Task 
 - Credit card data
 - Inspecting the data
 - Handling the missing data (part i)
 - Handling the missing data (part ii)
 - Handling the missing data (part iii)
 - Preprocessing the data (part i)
 - Splitting the dataset into train and test sets
 - Preprocessing the data (part ii)
 - Fitting a logistic regression model to the train set
 - Making predictions and evaluating performance

## Steps to run on local system
 - Clone the repository
