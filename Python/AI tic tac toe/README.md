# AI Tic Tac Toe.

# About the Project:
  - It is a Tic Tac Toe Game where user plays with computer.

# Tech Stack Used:
  - It is made by using Python(not the zoo's ðŸ¥²)

# Install Dependecies:
  - from math import inf as infinity
  - from random import choice
  - import platform
  - import time
  - from os import system
  - These above depencies must be installed and python must be above 3.8.x.

# Video Demonstration:

- Only one Test Case is shown here.
- Rest must be figured by you guys ðŸ¥².

# MinMax Method:
- What is MinMax Method?
  - Minimax is a artificial intelligence applied in two player games, such as tic-tac-toe, checkers, chess and go. This games are known as zero-sum games, because in a mathematical representation: one player wins (+1) and other player loses (-1) or both of anyone not to win (0).
- How does it works?

The algorithm search, recursively, the best move that leads the Max player to win or not lose (draw). It consider the current state of the game and the available moves at that state, then for each valid move it plays (alternating min and max) until it finds a terminal state (win, draw or lose).

- Understanding the Algorithm

    -The algorithm was studied by the book Algorithms in a Nutshell (George Heineman; Gary Pollice; Stanley Selkow, 2009). Pseudocode (adapted):

minimax(state, depth, player)

	if (player = max) then
		best = [null, -infinity]
	else
		best = [null, +infinity]

	if (depth = 0 or gameover) then
		score = evaluate this state for player
		return [null, score]

	for each valid move m for player in state s do
		execute move m on s
		[move, score] = minimax(s, depth - 1, -player)
		undo move m on s

		if (player = max) then
			if score > best.score then best = [move, score]
		else
			if score < best.score then best = [move, score]

	return best
end
Now we'll see each part of this pseudocode with Python implementation. The Python implementation is available at this repository. First of all, consider it:

board = [ [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0] ]
MAX = +1
MIN = -1
The MAX may be X or O and the MIN may be O or X, whatever. The board is 3x3.

def minimax(state, depth, player):
state: the current board in tic-tac-toe (node)
depth: index of the node in the game tree
player: may be a MAX player or MIN player
if player == MAX:
	return [-1, -1, -infinity]
else:
	return [-1, -1, +infinity]
Both players start with your worst score. If player is MAX, its score is -infinity. Else if player is MIN, its score is +infinity. Note: infinity is an alias for inf (from math module, in Python).

The best move on the board is [-1, -1] (row and column) for all.

if depth == 0 or game_over(state):
	score = evaluate(state)
	return score
If the depth is equal zero, then the board hasn't new empty cells to play. Or, if a player wins, then the game ended for MAX or MIN. So the score for that state will be returned.

If MAX won: return +1
If MIN won: return -1
Else: return 0 (draw)
Now we'll see the main part of this code that contains recursion.

for cell in empty_cells(state):
	x, y = cell[0], cell[1]
	state[x][y] = player
	score = minimax(state, depth - 1, -player)
	state[x][y] = 0
	score[0], score[1] = x, y
For each valid moves (empty cells):

x: receives cell row index
y: receives cell column index
state[x][y]: it's like board[available_row][available_col] receives MAX or MIN player
score = minimax(state, depth - 1, -player):
state: is the current board in recursion;
depth -1: index of the next state;
-player: if a player is MAX (+1) will be MIN (-1) and vice versa.
The move (+1 or -1) on the board is undo and the row, column are collected.

The next step is compare the score with best.

if player == MAX:
	if score[2] > best[2]:
		best = score
else:
	if score[2] < best[2]:
		best = score
For MAX player, a bigger score will be received. For a MIN player, a lower score will be received. And in the end, the best move is returned. Final algorithm:

def minimax(state, depth, player):
	if player == MAX:
		best = [-1, -1, -infinity]
	else:
		best = [-1, -1, +infinity]

	if depth == 0 or game_over(state):
		score = evaluate(state)
		return [-1, -1, score]

	for cell in empty_cells(state):
		x, y = cell[0], cell[1]
		state[x][y] = player
		score = minimax(state, depth - 1, -player)
		state[x][y] = 0
		score[0], score[1] = x, y

		if player == MAX:
			if score[2] > best[2]:
				best = score
		else:
			if score[2] < best[2]:
				best = score

	return best
