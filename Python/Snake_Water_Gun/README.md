# Snake-Water-and-Gun-game-in-python (Description)
This is the snake, water and gun game written in python without using class. Here, the user will only play with the computer. The special thing in this game is that it will record all the timestamps of starting the game and who is playing the game. It also record that who won the particular match. So, I think I can upgrade it because I am uploading it after six month but its ok.

## Feature Type
