# Building games in Python

## Description 

  Turtle is a Python library which used to create graphics, pictures, and games. It was developed by Wally Feurzeig, Seymour Parpet and Cynthina Slolomon in 1967.
  Turtle enables users to create pictures and shapes by providing them with a virtual canvas. The onscreen pen that you use for drawing is called the turtle and this is what gives the library its name. In short, the Python turtle library helps new programmers get a feel for what programming with Python is like in a fun and interactive way.
