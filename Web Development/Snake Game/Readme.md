## About The Project


I am sure everyone of us has played the OG Snake Game. It was one game which we all loved. Using HTML, CSS and JavaScript I have tried to recreate our childhood snake game. The objective of the game is to eat as much food as possible without bumping into the wall or touching the snake's body. I have also tried to make the game more immersive by adding some sound effects.
