### Description

Hii I'm a GSSoc22 contributor and I'm looking to make a pr request in this repo regarding my project which is a Dice-roller -game.

### The idea behind this project :
Like in when we want to delete any secure info from any sites then it retells us you are going to delete it if may cause all your personal data loss.

### How does it work
In the starting, there will be only deleted button and when we click on it then there is a pop come are you sure to delete it. Then after clicking alert msg will preview like yes I want to delete confirm it.

for more details please refer to this attached images.
