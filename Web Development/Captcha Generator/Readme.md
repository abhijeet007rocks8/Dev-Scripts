### The idea behind the project 
Whenever we login into a high-security app or website You can take the example of IRCT which huge collection of databases. Then each time while login we need to enter a captcha after all verification and it acts as the last step for authentication.

while loading you will have a collection of random latter that you need to enter this captcha in the input box if it will match then it will preview a message of matched otherwise an error message.
You will have a refresh button that you need to refresh whenever you want a new collection of latter.
